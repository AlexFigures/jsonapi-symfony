# Security Policy

We take the security of JsonApiBundle seriously and appreciate coordinated disclosure from the community.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Submit a private report using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/AlexFigures/jsonapi-symfony/security/advisories/new) so maintainers can triage confidentially.
3. If you prefer email, contact the maintainers at [security@alexfigures.dev](mailto:security@alexfigures.dev). Include:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact
   - Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
   - Any mitigation you have identified

You will receive an acknowledgement within **48 hours**. We aim to provide an initial assessment and remediation timeline within **5 business days**.

## Disclosure Process

- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a release date with you.
- After publishing a release that contains the fix, we will disclose the vulnerability details and credit reporters (unless you request anonymity).
- If we do not hear back within 14 days at any stage, we may proceed with disclosure to protect the community.

Thank you for helping keep JsonApiBundle secure.
